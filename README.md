Let's add another requirement:

room_name should start with ROOM_ and be longer than 8 chars

To begin let's add the associated tests.

Step 1 : 
I've created the function def verify_room_name(room_name)

Step 2 :
I've added a test for the new function verify_room_name

Step 3 :
I've removed the first test and added a fancier

Step 5 : 
I've coded the function verify_room_name

Step 6:
test commit
