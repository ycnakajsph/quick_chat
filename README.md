Let's add another requirement:

room_name should start with ROOM_ and be longer than 8 chars

To begin let's add the associated tests.

Step 1 :
I've created the function def verify_room_name(room_name)

Step 2 :
I've added a test for the new function verify_room_name

Step 3 :
I've removed the first test and added a fancier

Step 5 :
I've coded the function verify_room_name

Step 6 :

We've created 2 other functions named verify_room_type and verify_user_password (due to organisation problems and the fact that we learned very recently about the work, we wrote the code before the test)

Step 7 :

We've created 2 other tests for those 2 functions. We test various types of room_type and password to ensure that every bug should be detected. We separated each aspect of the test (one aspect = one assertFalse or True). The last attempt is always a valid one.

Each test tests only one function (really important)



Let's add another requirement:

username should be unique and should not contain any number or special character

To begin let's add the associated tests.

Step 1 : I've created the function def verify_username(username)

Step 2 : I've added a test for the new function verify_username (test_verify_username)

Step 3 : I've coded the function verify_username
